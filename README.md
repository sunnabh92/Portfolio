# Portfolio
Collection of assignments I have done in my studies and will soon have some other things that I have played with.

At the time I make this I am a second year college student, studying computer science at Reykjav√≠k University and scheduled to graduate spring 2023.
I decided to make this portfolio because I know it can help me show what I have done and how I have grown in a short time when it comes to these studies.
Right now I don't have a lot, I am still working on few things and adding on to my schedule some assignments that are not for school but more for my own interest. I am very proud of how far I have come, after the first year i was convinced I would not be able to program. All of the assignments I will put in here is something I did completely myself and will mention if I worked the assignment in a group.
